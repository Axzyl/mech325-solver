# mech325-solver

This solver is an interactive HTML-based tool for solving problems in the machine design (MECH 325) course at UBC. The solver is based on two student guides (one by fizz and one by mech), adding interactive text boxes and automatic calculations in order to keep calculations quick, easy to follow, and easy to show your work on assignments and exams. 

In order to run this, download this repository (easiest way is to click Code -> Download ZIP, and then unzip the folder), then open ```index.html``` in your preferred browser. 

As of Oct 19, I have not started on the second homework and have not tested this solver much. I vibe coded this solver in an afternoon while playing mario kart (I played the DLC for the first time on my clubroom's switch), so there may be some issues. If that happens, contact me on Discord at @Axzyl (or raise an issue, but I don't check github much), letting me know what the issue is, and if it is an issue with the content not being implemented properly, let me know what it should be so I can fix (vibecode) it. 

Future Plans:
- Adding support for Belts
- Power Fluids and all other units coming up later
- Integrated Offline LLM (for learning purposes, of course)
